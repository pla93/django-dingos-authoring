# Inline Interfaces
# -----------------
#
# Django offers the possibility to enrich an admin
# interfaces with admin areas for related objects
# that are 'inlined' into the main interface.
# To achieve this, Inline-classes have to
# be defined.
#
# We use the following naming convention:
#
# XXXXXXX[_zzzzzz_][_]YYYYYYYInline
#
# means that object XXXXXX contains an inline for object YYYYYYYY.
# 'zzzzzz' may be used if the same YYYYYY object is inlined in several
# ways according to multiple relations between XXXXXX and YYYYYY -- see
# examples below).  Underbars may be used to separate names where
# camel-casing gets to confusing.
#
# In inline interface, use the properties 'verbose_name' and 'verbose_name_plural'
# to provide information about the way in which inlines are related to the
# main object.
#
#





#
# Admin Interfaces
# ----------------
#
# Below we specify admin interfaces in which
# we tweak the behavior of the standard admin
# interface:
#
# - list_display: which fields to display in the list of objects
# - list_filter: which fields can be used for filtering the list of objects
# - inlines: which admin interfaces should be inlined?
#
# We also hook into the save-on-change/create mechanism
# to do additional changes where necessary.
#
#

class GroupNamespaceMapAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
    list_display = ('group','default_namespace')
    fields = ('group','default_namespace','allowed_namespaces')
    raw_id_fields = ('default_namespace',)
    autocomplete_lookup_fields = {
        'fk': ['default_namespace'],

    }

class AuthoredDataAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
    list_display = ('identifier','timestamp','latest','kind','status','name','user','group')
    fields = ('kind','status','author_view','identifier','processing_id','name','user','group','timestamp','latest','data')



#
# Registration
# ------------
#
# Below, we register admin interfaces.
#


admin.site.register(AuthorView)

admin.site.register(AuthoredData,AuthoredDataAdmin)
#admin.site.register(AuthorView)
admin.site.register(GroupNamespaceMap,GroupNamespaceMapAdmin)
