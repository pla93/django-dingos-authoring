class DingosAuthoringImportCommand(DingoImportCommand):
    """
    This class serves as basis for import commands that are specified
    in the management/commands directory of a Django app using DINGO
    for imports.

    It basically adds the following command line arguments and associated
    processing to the Dingo.BaseCommand class:

    - `--marking_json` is used to specify a json file that contains
      data for an information object with which all information objects
      generated by the XML import are to be marked. Here is an example
      the contents of such a json file::

           {"Mechanism" : {"Category":"Commandline Import",
                           "User": "DINGO[_username]",
                           "Commandline": {"Command":"DINGO[_command]",
				           "KeywordArguments":"DINGO[_kargs]",
				           "Arguments":"DINGO[_args]"}
	                      },
          "Source" : "DINGO[source]"}

      As becomes apparent above, the JSON may contain placeholders.
      of form 'DINGO[<placeholder_name>]'. Placeholders with names
      that start with a '_' are filled in automatically -- the definition
      for user-defined placeholders is provided with the
      command-line argument --marking-pfill.

    - `--marking-pfill` takes a list of arguments that are processed pairwise:
      the first component of each pair is interpreted as placeholder name,
      the second as value to fill in for that placeholder.

      To fill in the 'source' placeholder in the above example, you
      might call the command line with::

                  --marking-pfill  source "Regular import from Malware Sandbox"

      Be sure to encompass placeholder values in quotation marks
      (If you are using PyCharm as IDE: note that PyCharm messes up quoted
      commandline arguments in its run configuration -- you have to test
      that stuff from a true commandline).
    - `--id-namespace-uri` stores URI for namespace to be used for qualifying
         the identifiers of the information objects.
